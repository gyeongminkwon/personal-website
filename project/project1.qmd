- Developed a machine learning model to analyze opponent betting patterns and predict betting risk.

- Advocated for a more complex approach to data modeling, transitioning from one-dimensional models like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost to more complex models like MLP and LSTM. Refined feature selection and improved model accuracy from 0.52 to 0.72.
